# Assignment 5 :smile:
## Factor and figure management

- In this repository, you can find:
    * I completed all parts.
    * I found a way to display the output of str() more reader-friendly.
    * I comment the ggplotly() function in my .md file. If you want to see the output of ggplotly(), please go to my .html file.
    * This assignment is quite long so I used TOC which is helpful to navigate my md much quicker.
